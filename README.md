# Umarket
<h1>Umarket, an online web store project.</h1>

This is my first huge personal project after finishing my first Udemy course.

Umarket is a Web application that **simulates** an online shopping store.
It is made using:
- HTML and CSS with a bit of Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript (also EJS) for Front End.
- NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB for Back End.

The project is commited to this repository a bit later after it was started due to my lack of knowledge about GITHUB.

<h2>Features</h2>
This project has a TON of new different features implemented by me in addition to those learned in the course.<br>
The course's final project was a "very basic" web page about Campgrounds. Just HTML, a bit of CSS and EJS, and basic CRUD.
Also that project will be uploaded to my GitHub profile as well.<br>

<b>Coming soon features:</b><br>
- Shopping cart to quickly add or remove products.
- Buyer and seller notifications.
- Media queries (to all pages).
- More product categories and sub-categories.
- Working footer links.
- Premium membership (you can still select premium shipping).
- Product Images Magnifier.
- Search filters.
- Pagination.

Remember this is my first huge project and some things could be bad implemented or some bugs can appear.
